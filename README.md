## Features

AuraDo comes packed with functionalities to supercharge your task management:

* **Persistent Storage:** All your tasks are automatically saved to and loaded from your browser's Local Storage, ensuring your data persists even after closing the browser.
* **Add/Edit/Delete Tasks:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for managing your tasks seamlessly. Double-click on any task text to edit it in place.
* **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:** Easily toggle task completion status. Completed tasks are visually distinct and automatically move to the bottom when sorted.
* **Filtering Options:** View tasks by "All," "Active," or "Completed" status.
* **Dynamic Sorting:** Sort your tasks by:
    * **Recently Added / Oldest Added:** Based on the task's creation timestamp.
    * **Due Date (Soonest) / Due Date (Latest):** Organize by proximity to due dates. Tasks without due dates are handled gracefully.
* **Due Date Management:**
    * Assign specific due dates to your tasks.
    * Overdue tasks are visually highlighted for quick identification.
    * Due dates disappear when a task is completed and reappear if uncompleted.
* **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Manually reorder tasks within the list by dragging them to your preferred position.
* **Real-time Task Counts:** Displays current counts of active, completed, and total tasks.
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between a light and a comfortable dark theme, with your preference saved to Local Storage.
* **Custom Confirmation Modals:** Enhanced user experience with custom, styled confirmation dialogs instead of native browser prompts.
* **Smooth Animations:** Subtle visual effects for adding and removing tasks from the list.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
* **Input Validation:** Prevents adding empty tasks with visual feedback.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure of the web application.
* **CSS3:** Styling and responsive design, including theme management.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic, DOM manipulation, local storage management, and all interactive features.
